Objects and classes are foundational elements in Java for object-oriented programming.&nbsp;

You can think of a class as the blueprint for the object. A class will define what something is supposed to have, the data, and what it can do, the methods. A class is a template and not an object itself, rather it defines the specifications of the object. For an example if the class is a car, the car class defines what type of cars. The objects in the class can be one blue car that is a sedan and one red car that is an SUV. They are both in the car class but are different objects in that class.&nbsp;
